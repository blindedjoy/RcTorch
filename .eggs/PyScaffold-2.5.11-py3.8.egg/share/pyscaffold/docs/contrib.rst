If you would like to contribute to PyScaffold, fork the `main repository
<https://github.com/blue-yonder/pyscaffold/>`_ on GitHub with the help of
`Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_, then submit a “pull request” (PR):

#. `Create an account <https://github.com/signup/free>`_ on GitHub if you do
   not already have one.
#. Fork the project repository: click on the *Fork* button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.
#. Clone this copy to your local disk::

    git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pyscaffold.git

#. Run ``python setup.py egg_info`` after a fresh checkout. This will generate
   some critically needed files.
#. Create a branch to hold your changes::

    git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work on the master branch!

#. Start your work on this branch. When you’re done editing, do::

    git add modified_files
    git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with::

    git push -u origin my-feature

#. Go to the web page of your PyScaffold fork, and click
   "Create pull request" to send your changes to the maintainers for review.
