deprecations:
  - |
    *testr* and *nose* integration has been deprecated. This feature allowed
    *pbr* to dynamically configure the test runner used when running
    ``setup.py test``. However, this target has fallen out of favour in both
    the OpenStack and broader Python ecosystem, and both *testr* and *nose*
    offer native setuptools commands that can be manually aliased to ``test``
    on a per-project basis, if necessary. This feature will be removed in a
    future release.
