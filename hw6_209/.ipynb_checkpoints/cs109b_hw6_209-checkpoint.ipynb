    "### Overview\n",
    "We discussed in class the formulation of Reservoir Computing (RC), an echo-state recurrent neural network. One of the examples that we discussed was the Mackey-Glass nonlinear dynamical system. This example can be found in the seminal paper: http://www.rctn.org/vs265/jaeger04-ESN.pdf. This is the paper that introduced RC, so we highly encourage you to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you are asked to work on the Rossler dynamical system. It is a very popular chaotic system that has been used to describe the evolution of chemical reactions. For more information check the Wikipedia page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor\n",
    "For the implementation of the RC you have to use the class `pyESN` which is available at  https://github.com/cknd/pyESN. In this github repository you can also find the Mackey-Glass example. We encourage you to explore this library. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the homework, you have to employ the RC network to predict the time evolution of a chaotic time series.  We provide you three time series `x(t), y(t), z(t)` (files: `x.dat`, `y.dat`, `z.dat`), which are the solutions of the chaotic Rossler system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first question you are asked to make a short-range forecast. It is a prediction where the network is learning from the past (training set) and trying to make a future prediction based on the past. In this case the prediction is not a response to the previous signal, therefore, the input should be an array of ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second  question you are asked to make a long-range forecast. You have to confirm that making a prediction by learning only the past yields very bad performance. This is expected because we deal with a very difficult (chaotic) time-series. On the other hand, we saw in the class that by  using the concept of the `observers`  we can perform extremely long-range forecast. To include the observers you need to use three different inputs: a vector of ones, and the two other known time series `y(t)` and `z(t)` (the observers). In this case the prediction is a response to the past behavior and also to the present observers' signals. This kind of predictions are called **inference**. For the inference, we need to know the values of the `observers` also for the future values, since they are used as inputs in the RC. This is why we have an inference instead of a pure forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the class RC is very sensitive to the hyper-parameters. In all the questions you are asked to find the optimal set of hyper-parameters that gives the best predictions. For convenience, we are asking you to optimize just two of the hyper-parameters, the `spectrum radius`  and `sparsity term`.  The rest of the hyper-parameters are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this homework are for you to:\n",
    "1. learn the mechanics of RC\n",
    "2. confirm that RC training is fast\n",
    "3. learn how to use RC for forecasting\n",
    "4. acknowledge that RC is sensitive to hyper-parameters (no free lunch)\n",
    "5. learn how to optimize hyper-parameters of RC\n",
    "6. evaluate RC forecasting\n",
    "7. learn observers-based RC for inference"
