Mi Marios,

All you need to do is permission and run run.sh. Once you are in the "MARIOS" directory simply run:

	"chmod a+x run.sh; ./run.sh"

It's possible that you may need to install packages such as "multiprocessing", those dependencies should come up quickly through errors and you can install the required packages with pip as usual.
